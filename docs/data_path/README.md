# Data Path Module

This module connects and manages data transfer between the CPU's **functional units** — specifically, the **register file** and the **ALU**.

It reads data from the register file, performs an ALU operation based on the `OpCode`, and writes the result back into the register file if `write_en` is asserted.


## 📥 Inputs

| Signal Name | Width    | Description |
|:------------|:---------|:------------|
| `read_add1` | 5 bits    | Address of the first register to read from. |
| `read_add2` | 5 bits    | Address of the second register to read from. |
| `write_add` | 5 bits    | Address of the register to write the ALU result into. |
| `OpCode`    | 4 bits    | Operation code passed to the ALU (not the CPU instruction opcode!). |
| `write_en`  | 1 bit     | Write enable signal; controls whether data is written back to the register file. |
| `clk`       | 1 bit     | Clock signal for synchronous register operations. |
| `reset`     | 1 bit     | Resets the register file contents when asserted. |

## 📤 Outputs

| Signal Name | Width    | Description |
|:------------|:---------|:------------|
| `zero_f`    | 1 bit     | Set to 1 if the ALU result (`write_data`) is zero; otherwise 0. |


## 🛠️ Internal Connections

- **Register File (`reg_file`)**
  - Reads operands `read_data_1` and `read_data_2`.
  - Writes `write_data` back to a register if `write_en` is active.

- **ALU (`alu`)**
  - Takes `read_data_1`, `read_data_2`, and `OpCode` as inputs.
  - Produces `write_data` as the operation result and `zero_f` flag.

## 📝 Notes

- The `OpCode` must be generated by an external **Control Unit** (like the one you wrote earlier).
- The `reset` clears the register file.
- This module focuses purely on **data movement** and **computation** — no instruction decoding happens here.
